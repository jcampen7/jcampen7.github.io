				<p class ="indented">Here is the <a href="exams/old_exam_1_solution.pdf">solution</a> to that old exam. </p>


  			<h4>Feb. 14, 2018</h4>

				<p class ="indented">Exam review tonight (2/14) in 2155 Marston (our usual meeting place) from
				8:00 p.m. to whenever.  What better way to spend Valentine's Day? </p>

  			<h4>Feb. 13, 2018</h4>

				<p class ="indented">A <a href="exams/old_exam_1.pdf">previous version of exam 1</a>, to use
				as you see fit.</p>

  			<h4>Feb. 1, 2018</h4>

				<p>Arduino Club tonight: 8:00 p.m. in 2011 Coover.  We will be making bareduinos.
					There is even web site: <a href="../eClubs/homepage.htm">ISU Electronics Clubs</a>.</p>

			<h4>Jan. 30, 2018</h4>

				<p>The disappointment at not be able to do the quiz yesterday was palpable.  (At least
					for me, if not for you.)  In order to not miss out on so much fun, I have re-branded
					the quizzes into homework problems D6 and D7, and they are now part of HW set 3. Also note
					that there was a typo in the original HW 3 list of problems &mdash; this has now been
					repaired.  (What should have been E3 was originally listed as D3.) </p>


			<h4>Jan. 25, 2018</h4>

				<p>Audio Club tonight: 8:00 p.m. in 2011 Coover.  We will be talking about amplifier specs.</p>

			<h4>Jan. 22, 2018</h4>

				<ul>
					<li>No quiz today.</li>
					<li>HW 2 is available.  The due date is Jan. 26.</li>
					<li>Message from the bookstore: They have more copies of the text, if you are still trying to score one.</li>
				</ul>

			<h4>Jan. 15, 2018</h4>

				<p>Lab 1 and HW 1 are both available.  Note that Lab 1 is a two-week lab, meaning that you have this week and
					next week to do the work, and then the report is due during the week of Jan. 29.  On the homework, note
					that you will probably have to review the feedback material from 201 to do problem A3. The problem is easy,
					but you need to remember that classic formula for a feedback system.</p>

			<h4>Jan. 8, 2018</h4>

				<p>Here are the <a href="topics/intro.pdf">intro slides</a> used in class today.</p>

			<h4>Dec. 24, 2017</h4>

				<p>This is the web site for EE 230 &mdash; Spr 2018.</p>
